# Template for games seeking to use Zig and Raylib to achieve their goals
## Or simply to mess around

Features an example of a message/event system:
- Press <kbd>=</kbd> to bring up the debug view.
  - Includes information about the frame time and FPS.
- Press <kbd>p</kbd> to "pause" the "game".
  - Both of these words are in quotations as there really is no game to pause (and the only effect of "pausing" is displaying some "Paused" text on the screen).
 
Do with this what you will.
Godspeed.
